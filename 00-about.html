            I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/">School of Computer Science and Statistics</a> at Trinity College Dublin since September 2020.
            I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/index.shtml">Prof. Rachel McDonnell</a>. I'm interested in machine learning,
            computer graphics and animation, computer vision, and virtual reality.

            My original training was in mathematics. In 2014 I graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a First Class Honours degree in Mathematics.
            The following year I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge to receive a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) in Pure Mathematics.
            I then spent three and a half years  (2016-2019) working as an Actuarial Analyst, during which time I qualified as an Associate of the <a href="https://www.actuaries.org.uk/">Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.</a>
            I returned to Trinity College Dublin in 2019 to study for a MSc in Computer Science before beginning my PhD studies the following year.

            In my free time, my main obsession is running and you'll find me training for and running road races of any distance from 5km all the way up to the marathon.
