                I presented our paper <em>Light field style transfer with local angular consistency</em> at  the <a href="https://www.2021.ieeeicassp.org/2021.ieeeicassp.org/index.html">2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2021)</a>.

                ICASSP 2021 was my first ever academic conference. The conference was originally supposed to be held in Toronto, Canada but due to the pandemic it was held virtually. This meant I had
                to swap a first ever trip to Canada for Zoom presentations from my bedroom. Nevertheless, I still got to hear lots of interesting talks and meet other researchers (or at least their avatars).
                I presented our paper during the Image Synthesis session at the conference. You can check out more details and results from our work on the <a href="https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/research/neural-style-transfer-for-light-fields/">project webpage</a>.
