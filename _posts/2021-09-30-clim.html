            <p>Today I presented my research on light field style transfer at a <a href="http://clim.inria.fr/workshop2.html">workshop</a> on <em>computational imaging with new imaging modalities</em>
                organised by the <a href="http://clim.inria.fr/index.html">ERC CLIM project</a> at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr">Inria</a> in Rennes, France. You can check out the video 
                of my presentation <em> light field style transfer with local angular consistency</em> <a href="https://videos-rennes.inria.fr/video/ZQiy-mQbi">here</a>.
            <!--more--> I also got to hear lots of fascinating talks from other researchers in the field during the two-day workshop. Videos of most of the talks are available on the workshop webpage.
