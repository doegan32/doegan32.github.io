                This week I presented our paper <em>How to train your dog: Neural enhancement of quadruped animations</em> at  the 
                <a href="http://mig2021.inria.fr">14th ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Motion, Interaction and Games (MIG 2021)</a>.

                After missing out on a trip to Canada earlier in the year for ICASSP 2021, the pandemic now caused me to miss out on a winter trip to Lausanne, Switzerland. 
                Once again, in-person conference attendance was swapped for Zoom presentations from my bedroom. I presented our paper, a collaboration with our colleagues from the University of Bath, at the learning 
                paper session on day one of the conference. You can watch a video of my presentation here:
