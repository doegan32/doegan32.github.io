            Today I ran my first ever marathon. I finished the 2022 Marathon de Paris in 3 hours 11 minutes and 38 seconds. Check out <a href="/2022/04/03/Paris-Marathon.html">here</a> for some pictures of the day.

            Here's a snap of me just after I crossed the finish line:

        And here's a snap after I've got my breadth back and with the Arc de Triomphe in the background:

            When I signed up, the goal was to do a sub 3 hour marathon. However, an achilles injury in January meant I had to take most of February off running and I barely ran longer than 10km in the two months before the marathon. 
            Given this setback, I'm really happy with 3 hours 11 minutes and 38 seconds. The goal now has to be to go sub 3 early in 2023.
