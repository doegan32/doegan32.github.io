                Durham in the UK. Check out <a href="/2022/09/15/SCA-2022.html">this</a> blog post for more.

                We heard some great keynotes, including from our own <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/index.shtml">Prof. Rachel McDonnell</a>, together with some great paper presentations.
                We met lots of interesting people, including some famous faces from the field. Check out this picture below of some of the team with <a href="https://theorangeduck.com/page/about">Daniel Holden</a>.
