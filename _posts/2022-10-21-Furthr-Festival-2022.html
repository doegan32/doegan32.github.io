            and demo'd some of our work at the Tech Arcade. Check out this promotional video made by <a href="https://garethyoung.org/">Gareth Young</a> to see how we got on and

                Myself, <a href="https://mauriciofvargas.com/">Mauricio</a> and Caoimhe spent the day showing off the latest iteration of our virtual reality music and dance experience. Check out the 
                screen grab below to get an idea of our work (although to gain the full experience it needs be experienced in VR). Mauricio composed the music and looked after the audio, Caoimhe did all of 
                of the choreography, and I looked after the visuals.
