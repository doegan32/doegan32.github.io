        <p>
            I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/">School of Computer Science and Statistics</a> at Trinity College Dublin since September 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            My original training was in mathematics. In 2014 I graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a First Class Honours degree in Mathematics.
            The following year I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge to receive a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) in Pure Mathematics.
            I then spent three and a half years  (2016-2019) working as an Actuarial Analyst, during which time I qualified as an Associate of the <a href="https://www.actuaries.org.uk/">Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.</a>
            I returned to Trinity College Dublin in 2019 to study for a MSc in Computer Science before beginning my PhD studies the following year.
